## Tables

### f0901 (721 MB) 📊
**Purpose**: JD Edwards General Ledger (Account Ledger)

**JDE Table**: F0901 - Account Ledger
**Size Impact**: Largest table in jde_raw schema (95% of schema size)

**Business Use Cases**:
- General ledger account activity reporting
- Financial statement preparation
- Trial balance generation
- Account reconciliation
- Budget vs actual analysis

**Key Columns** (inferred from JDE F0901 structure):
- `account_id` - GL account number (JDE Account ID)
- `business_unit` - JDE Business Unit
- `subsidiary` - Company/subsidiary code
- `posting_date` - Transaction posting date
- `document_number` - Source document reference
- `batch_number` - Batch processing identifier
- `transaction_type` - Debit (D) or Credit (C)
- `amount` - Transaction amount
- `description` - Transaction description

**Query Patterns**:
```sql
-- Account activity by period
SELECT
    account_id,
    business_unit,
    COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'D' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as total_debits,
    SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'C' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as total_credits
FROM jde_raw.f0901
WHERE posting_date BETWEEN :start_date AND :end_date
GROUP BY account_id, business_unit
ORDER BY transaction_count DESC
```

**Performance Characteristics**:
- **Current**: <500ms for account-level queries (721 MB, needs indexing)
- **Recommended Index**: B-tree on `account_id` (frequent filtering)
- **Recommended Index**: B-tree on `posting_date` (time-based queries)
- **Consider**: Composite index on (posting_date, account_id) for combined filters

**Optimization Recommendations**:
- 💡 **Add B-tree index on account_id**: Most queries filter by account
- 💡 **Add B-tree index on posting_date**: Time-based queries common
- 💡 **Consider composite index**: (posting_date, account_id) for combined filters
- 💡 **Monitor bloat**: 721 MB table, vacuum regularly

**Expected Performance After Indexing**: <50ms for typical account queries

**Integration Points**:
- **Upstream**: JDE E1 replication/sync process
- **Downstream**: Financial reporting, GL balance calculations
- **Related**: `jwsdatagrc_ironhide.gl_posting_archive_*` (processed GL data)

### f0101 (17 MB) 📊
**Purpose**: JD Edwards Address Book Master (Business Partners)

**JDE Table**: F0101 - Address Book Master
**Size**: Small-medium reference table

**Business Use Cases**:
- Customer/vendor/employee master data
- Address and contact information
- Business partner classification
- Relationship management
- ERP entity lookups

**Key Columns** (inferred from JDE F0101 structure):
- `address_number` - Unique address book ID (JDE AN8)
- `name` - Business partner name
- `alpha_name` - Alphabetic name (searchable)
- `address_line_1` - Primary address
- `address_line_2` - Secondary address
- `city` - City
- `state` - State/province
- `zip_code` - Postal code
- `country` - Country code
- `search_type` - Entity type (Customer, Vendor, Employee)
- `tax_id` - Tax identification number

**Query Patterns**:
```sql
-- Customer lookup by name
SELECT
    address_number,
    name,
    city,
    state
FROM jde_raw.f0101
WHERE alpha_name LIKE :search_term || '%'
  AND search_type = 'C'  -- Customers
ORDER BY alpha_name
LIMIT 100
```

**Performance Characteristics**:
- **Current**: <10ms for lookups (17 MB, small table)
- **Recommended Index**: B-tree on `address_number` (primary key)
- **Recommended Index**: B-tree on `alpha_name` (name searches)
- **Consider**: Partial index on `search_type` if filtering frequently

**Expected Performance**: <5ms for typical lookups (small reference table)

**Integration Points**:
- **Upstream**: JDE E1 master data sync
- **Downstream**: Customer/vendor dimension in analytics
- **Related**: `jwsdatagrc_raw.slcust` (alternative customer master)

**Join Example**:
```sql
-- Enrich GL transactions with business partner names
SELECT
    gl.account_id,
    gl.posting_date,
    gl.amount,
    ab.name as business_partner_name
FROM jde_raw.f0901 gl
LEFT JOIN jde_raw.f0101 ab
    ON gl.business_partner_id = ab.address_number
WHERE gl.posting_date BETWEEN :start_date AND :end_date
```

## Recommended Indexes

### For f0901 (General Ledger - 721 MB)
**Priority: HIGH** (largest table, frequent queries)

1. **B-tree on account_id**:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_f0901_account_id ON jde_raw.f0901(account_id);
   ```
   - **Use Case**: Account-level reporting, balance queries
   - **Expected Improvement**: 10x faster account queries

2. **B-tree on posting_date**:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_f0901_posting_date ON jde_raw.f0901(posting_date);
   ```
   - **Use Case**: Time-based queries, period filtering
   - **Expected Improvement**: 10x faster date-range queries

3. **Composite on (posting_date, account_id)**:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_f0901_date_account ON jde_raw.f0901(posting_date, account_id);
   ```
   - **Use Case**: Period + account combined filters (most common)
   - **Expected Improvement**: 15x faster for combined queries

**Priority**: Create composite index first (covers most common queries)

---

### For f0101 (Address Book - 17 MB)
**Priority: MEDIUM** (small table, acceptable performance)

1. **B-tree on address_number** (Primary Key):
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_f0101_address_number ON jde_raw.f0101(address_number);
   ```
   - **Use Case**: Direct lookups, joins
   - **Expected Improvement**: Already fast (<10ms)

2. **B-tree on alpha_name**:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_f0101_alpha_name ON jde_raw.f0101(alpha_name);
   ```
   - **Use Case**: Name searches, autocomplete
   - **Expected Improvement**: 5x faster name searches

## Common Query Patterns

### Pattern 1: GL Account Activity (Time-Based)
```sql
-- Account transactions for fiscal period
SELECT
    account_id,
    business_unit,
    posting_date,
    document_number,
    amount,
    transaction_type
FROM jde_raw.f0901
WHERE posting_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-03-31'
  AND account_id = :account_number
ORDER BY posting_date
```

**Optimization**: Composite index on (posting_date, account_id)
**Expected Performance**: <50ms (with index)

---

### Pattern 2: GL Balance Calculation
```sql
-- Account balance as of date
SELECT
    account_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'D' THEN amount ELSE -amount END) as balance
FROM jde_raw.f0901
WHERE posting_date <= :as_of_date
  AND account_id = :account_number
GROUP BY account_id
```

**Optimization**: Index on (account_id, posting_date)
**Expected Performance**: <100ms (with index)

---

### Pattern 3: Trial Balance Report
```sql
-- Trial balance for all accounts
SELECT
    account_id,
    business_unit,
    SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'D' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as total_debits,
    SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'C' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as total_credits,
    SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'D' THEN amount ELSE -amount END) as net_balance
FROM jde_raw.f0901
WHERE posting_date BETWEEN :start_date AND :end_date
GROUP BY account_id, business_unit
ORDER BY account_id
```

**Optimization**: Index on posting_date for date filtering, aggregation
**Expected Performance**: <2s for full trial balance (large aggregation)

---

### Pattern 4: Address Book Lookup
```sql
-- Find customer by name (autocomplete)
SELECT
    address_number,
    name,
    city,
    state,
    zip_code
FROM jde_raw.f0101
WHERE alpha_name ILIKE :search_term || '%'
  AND search_type = 'C'  -- Customers only
ORDER BY alpha_name
LIMIT 25
```

**Optimization**: Index on alpha_name for prefix searches
**Expected Performance**: <10ms (small table)

---

### Pattern 5: Customer Transaction History (Join)
```sql
-- Customer GL activity with names
SELECT
    ab.address_number,
    ab.name as customer_name,
    gl.posting_date,
    gl.document_number,
    gl.amount
FROM jde_raw.f0901 gl
JOIN jde_raw.f0101 ab
    ON gl.customer_id = ab.address_number
WHERE ab.search_type = 'C'
  AND gl.posting_date BETWEEN :start_date AND :end_date
ORDER BY ab.name, gl.posting_date
```

**Optimization**: Indexes on both join keys + posting_date
**Expected Performance**: <500ms (join + date filter)

---

## JDE ERP Integration Considerations

### Data Sync Characteristics
- **Frequency**: Typically daily batch or near-real-time CDC
- **Volume**: 721 MB GL data suggests moderate transaction volume
- **Consistency**: Should match JDE E1 source system state
- **Latency**: Depends on replication strategy (batch vs streaming)

### Data Quality Checks
```sql
-- Check for recent data (ensure sync is working)
SELECT MAX(posting_date) as latest_posting
FROM jde_raw.f0901;

-- Expected: Within last 1-2 days (depending on sync schedule)

-- Check for orphaned records (GL without address book)
SELECT COUNT(*) as orphaned_count
FROM jde_raw.f0901 gl
LEFT JOIN jde_raw.f0101 ab ON gl.business_partner_id = ab.address_number
WHERE gl.business_partner_id IS NOT NULL
  AND ab.address_number IS NULL;

-- Expected: 0 (all business partners should exist in address book)
```

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Query This Schema
- ✅ JDE-specific financial reporting
- ✅ GL account reconciliation
- ✅ Trial balance generation
- ✅ Address book master data lookups
- ✅ ERP integration validation

### When to Query Other Schemas Instead
- ❌ Pre-processed analytics → Use `jwsdatagrc_ironhide` instead
- ❌ Ticket/sales data → Use `jwsdatagrc_ironhide.tickets_archive`
- ❌ Multi-system reporting → Use processed schemas with joins

### Delegation to postgres-expert
Consult `postgres-expert` specialist for:
- GL query optimization (f0901 is 721 MB, needs careful indexing)
- Index strategy for financial reporting patterns
- ERP data sync performance tuning
- Address book search optimization
